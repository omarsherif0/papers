        <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper challenges the prevailing dominance of autoregressive (AR) models for code generation. It investigates diffusion-based language models (DLLMs), which generate text in a non-sequential, block-wise manner, offering potential advantages in efficiency and data reuse. The authors introduce <strong>Stable-DiffCoder</strong>, a specialized diffusion-based code model. Through a controlled study (reusing the Seed-Coder architecture, data, and pipeline for a fair comparison), they develop a **block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT)** stage with a tailored noise schedule to ensure stable training. The key result is that, under the same budgets, <strong>Stable-DiffCoder outperforms its AR counterpart</strong> and a range of ~8B parameter AR and DLLM baselines. The model is also shown to be particularly effective for structured code editing and benefits low-resource languages.

        <strong>Importance & Impact Assessment:</strong>
        <br>
        - <span class="ranking">Very High Impact</span>
        <br>
        - <strong>Subject Significance:</strong> This paper tackles a **foundational architectural question** at the heart of modern AI. It provides compelling empirical evidence that diffusion models can surpass autoregressive models for a critical task (code generation), a domain where AR models are currently state-of-the-art. This challenges the status quo and could redirect research and development towards a more efficient and capable architecture for code AI.
        <br>
        - <strong>Author Impact:</strong> The presence of authors from major tech players (Microsoft, Tencent) indicates the work is likely a serious, well-resourced effort from a leading industry/academic group, lending it credibility and ensuring it will be closely watched by the community.
        <br>
        - <strong>Key Contributions:** The paper's main value is in its **controlled, fair comparison** that cleanly demonstrates the superiority of a diffusion-based approach over AR for code. The introduction of a **stable CPT stage and tailored training schedule** for diffusion models is a key technical innovation. The findings have broad implications, suggesting diffusion models could be the next step in scaling and improving LLMs for structured data.

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Conclusion & Ranking:</strong> This is a **seminal and very high impact** paper. It presents a clear, well-controlled experimental finding that diffusion models can outperform autoregressive models for code generation. This is a significant contribution to the field's understanding of model architectures, potentially influencing the direction of future research. The technical contributions and results are substantial and noteworthy.
