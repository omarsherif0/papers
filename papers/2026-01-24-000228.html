        <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses a practical challenge in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Time-Series Forecasting (TSF): the high computational cost of fine-tuning versus the poor performance of directly applying pre-trained LLMs. The proposed solution, called **LVICL (Vector-Injected In-Context Learning)**, avoids fine-tuning by using a "learnable context vector adapter" to compress example information into a vector. This vector is injected into every layer of a **frozen** LLM to elicit its in-context learning ability for the TSF task. The key benefits are improved performance over standard prompting and more efficient inference than methods that use long prompts, as it doesn't increase prompt length. Experiments show its effectiveness.

        <strong>Importance & Impact Assessment:</strong>
        <br>
        - <span class="ranking">High Impact</span>
        <br>
        - <strong>Subject Significance:</strong> Time-series forecasting is a foundational task in numerous industries (finance, IoT, weather). Applying the power of LLMs to this domain is a hot research topic. This paper directly tackles a core bottleneck—**the efficiency vs. performance trade-off**—which is crucial for real-world adoption. The idea of using a *learnable* context vector, not just static examples, is an insightful and novel technical contribution.
        <br>
        - <strong>Author Impact:</strong> While the authors are not as widely recognized as some in the LLM field, the paper presents a clear, methodologically sound approach to a recognized problem. The technical merit of the proposed "vector injection" mechanism is the paper's main claim to importance.
        <br>
        - <strong>Key Contributions:** The primary contribution is a **parameter-efficient adaptation method** for LLM4TSF. By freezing the LLM and only training a small adapter, it promises significant compute savings. The core idea of learning a context vector to summarize examples and injecting it into the model is a creative twist on in-context learning that could inspire future work in efficient adaptation.

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Conclusion & Ranking:</strong> This is a **highly impactful** paper from a technical and practical standpoint. While it may not have the same author-driven prestige as some others, its focus on solving the **efficiency problem** for a **valuable application (time-series forecasting)** gives it strong relevance. The method is elegant, and the contribution is clear. It ranks highly among the provided papers for its direct practical value and innovation in efficient adaptation techniques.
