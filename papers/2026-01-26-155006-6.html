      <h3>Paper Details</h3>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16615v1" class="paper-link" target="_blank">AuroraEdge-V-2B: A Faster And Stronger Edge Visual Large Language Model</a></p>
      
      <h3>Key Findings &amp; Importance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compact and Efficient Design:</strong> AuroraEdge-V-2B has only 2B parameters, making it highly suitable for edge deployment and offering better real-time performance compared to larger VLLMs.</li>
        <li><strong>Compression-Fusion Method:</strong> The proposed compression-fusion method improves inference efficiency, reducing the number of visual tokens in the decoding process and cutting floating-point operations by half, which makes the model cheaper to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Performance:</strong> AuroraEdge-V-2B achieves higher scores on 9 benchmarks than models with a similar number of parameters, such as Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, and InternVL-2.5-2B, demonstrating its competitiveness and effectiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Addressing VLLM Challenges:</strong> The model addresses key challenges associated with traditional VLLMs, including their large size, slow inference speeds, and high computational resource requirements, making it a significant contribution to the development of more practical and efficient VLLMs for industrial applications.</li>
      </ul>
