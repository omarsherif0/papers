      <h3>Paper Details</h3>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903v3" class="paper-link" target="_blank">Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning</a></p>
      
      <h3>Key Findings & Importance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addresses a Practical Challenge:</strong> The work tackles the core dilemma in LLM4TSF: improving performance without the heavy computational cost of fine-tuning large models. The goal of keeping the frozen LLM is a significant efficiency win.</li>
        <li><strong>Novel Methodology:</strong> The core idea of <span class="highlight">Vector-Injected In-Context Learning (LVICL)</span> is the key contribution. Instead of bloating prompts, it uses a small adapter to learn a compressed context vector from examples and inject it directly into the LLM's layers. This is a novel and efficient approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted Improvement:</strong> The method is specifically designed to suppress "harmful" components in the example data for the forecasting task, which is a sophisticated and practical refinement over standard ICL.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> The impact is primarily within the niche of time-series forecasting with LLMs. While the method is clever, it doesn't propose a general breakthrough for LLMs outside this specific application.</li>
        <li><strong>Authors:</strong> The authors are from a Chinese university (Sun Yat-sen University). While the paper is well-structured, the authors' prominence in the broader LLM research community is less established compared to authors from major industrial labs or top-tier universities.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>This is a solid, well-motivated technical paper that contributes a useful and efficient method for a growing subfield (LLM4TSF). Its importance is specific but meaningful for researchers working on adapting LLMs for sequential data tasks.</p>
