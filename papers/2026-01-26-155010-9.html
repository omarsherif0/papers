      <h3>Paper Details</h3>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16538v1" class="paper-link" target="_blank">OnlineSI: Taming Large Language Model for Online 3D Understanding and Grounding</a></p>
      
      <h3>Key Findings &amp; Importance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OnlineSI Framework:</strong> The proposed framework maintains a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring that the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates, making it suitable for continuous operation in real-world environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration of 3D Point Cloud Information:</strong> The integration of 3D point cloud information with semantic information helps MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene, enhancing its spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuzzy $F_1$-Score Evaluation Metric:</strong> The introduction of the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score mitigates ambiguity in evaluation, providing a more accurate assessment of the framework's performance in online 3D understanding and grounding tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Effectiveness in Real-World Scenarios:</strong> Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OnlineSI in real-world scenarios, paving the way for the deployment of embodied systems that can continuously operate and adapt in ever-changing environments.</li>
      </ul>
